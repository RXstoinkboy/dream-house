# dream-house

UPDATE 19/04/2019
I have decided to abandon this project. I have face lots of issues with Zillow API, so I tried to switch to Yelp API. It was good idea but in this moment it is easier for me to start everything over from scratch instead of rebuilding it on basis of this repo. 

Even though, this project is abandoned, I might return to it in the future. I have also learned a ton of new things which hopefuly will be used by me in this new project "FindIt!" with much more elegance and sense right from the beginning.



DREAM HOUSE becomes MY-FINDER.

I will be honest. I thought that I will be able to do more with Zillow API. It turns out that a) I can't understand how to use it or b) it doesn't provide general search and there are issues with lots of data being restricted ...

My idea is to change this app into Yelp clone (with less functionality as I assume ... ) using their API (Yelp FUSION).
